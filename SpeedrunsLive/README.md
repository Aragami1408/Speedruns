# Speedruns Live

Speedrunslive.com is a site dedicated to speedrunning. You can get your stream
to show up here after being online for an hour by following the information in
this [FAQ][FAQ]. You are able to get to the front page as long as you are doing
speedrun related activity, and this is also a good location for doing your races
if you are involved in any. Most all of the races I've seen go through SRL, so
it's a good idea to get a feel for it if you plan on doing some races going
forward.
