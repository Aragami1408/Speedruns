# Dragon Warrior 1

## SFC

Notes for SFC races can be found [here][Dragon Warrior 1 SFC Race Notes]. This
details the level 18 Dragonlord run that is relatively risk adverse (as much as
can happen in this game), with good documentation on what the runners are doing
for even a general commentator to work with.
