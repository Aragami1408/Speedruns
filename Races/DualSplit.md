# DualSplit

DualSplit is a program made by [GameBoy9][GameBoy9] that can be used for Dragon
Warrior 1 (SFC) runs. It has a control panel that lets you manage the
runners/commentary and control the splits/timers for both runners. The source
can be found [here][GameBoy9 Repo]

## Exe

The exe in this repository is the one that I have for use with the race layout
in OBS, but the repository should be used for an up to date application
instance where needed.
