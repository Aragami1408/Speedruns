So I've given you some information about {Game} from the speedrunner and
speedrun watcher's perspective. Hopefully what you've heard will make you want
to jump in and start watching/playing and expand the community, but if not
that's not a problem. I'll try to be featuring a new episode every week so even
if {Game} isn't right for you, hopefully the next one or next several will
be. I've got a pretty expansive list of games that I watch/play personally, so
it makes sense that not everyone else will enjoy every game I discuss. Thanks
for listening, and if you like what you hear please subscribe to the podcast,
and if you really like it please support me on Patreon. Your support will go to
better equipment and more time that I'm able to spend researching to flood your
ears with even more information about new games to run/watch. Until next time
I'm drush211, and I'll talk to you later.
