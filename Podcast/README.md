# Podcasting

This file is meant to hold any and all information learned about the podcast
medium, and how to successfully set it up.

## Advertising

If you are showing gameplay footage in your podcast, you are limited in what you
are allowed to put ads on. You can't put ads on gameplay footage without consent
from the company in question, and sometimes it is even harder than that. If you
intend to use any of the music in a game, you have to also have permission from
the songs copyright holder. In general if you are doing games in your podcast,
you are likely better off just going without ads and going through Patreon or
something similar.

## Scripting

So depending on the length of your podcast, and the free flow nature, you might
want to have at least a partial "script" to go off of. This can be as simple as
a few bullet points like you would have in a powerpoint presentation, or as
detailed as having your opening and closing monologue hard typed out to just
read off of. It's always up to the person doing it to decide, but in general I
would recommend a script even if you don't plan on using any of it just because
it allows you to have clear/concise thoughts to what you might want to say. If
you have more than 1 person this becomes a little more difficult, but also
working on a script with another person can help you learn some of their thought
process and how to set them up for their own talking points better as well.
