# Golem

Golem is actually a much easier battle than you might imagine, it's really the
walk that is the hard part. I'll discuss both of those sections here. Also note
that both these sections assume you are at lvl 8 or above, used all 3 life
acorns, and had a good name for HP boosting.

## Golem Walk

Getting here will take a little bit of luck, but Once you get past the 2nd
bridge and enemies become more dangerous you should start using sleep if you are
concerned about not being able to flee. The enemies are usually around 85%
susceptible to sleep, except werewolf who is 100%. Enemies will likely out
speed you here however, so assume you will take a hit for casting sleep and
prepare accordingly.

## Golem Fight

This can be as easy/complicated as you would like. Golem will out speed you, but
he will always be put to sleep by the flute. If you wanted to be really safe,
you can flute/attack/flute/attack/etc... healing when necessary. Golem usually
gets around 2 turns of sleep before waking up, so the general tactic is
flute/attack/attack/flute/attack/attack/flute/etc... replacing attack with a
heal where necessary.
