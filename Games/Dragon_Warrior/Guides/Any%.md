# Dragon Warrior

Any % run on Emulator. I own the game on IPad, but that's not exactly a runnable
form. I've based my route off of a speed run from an [RPG Limit Break][1] run.

NOTE: Time starts after name is selected, and enter hit.

## Pixie Flute (Split 1)

  * Name your character Gyre for stat manipulation towards more strength.
  * Grab the first 3 chests, and the pot downstairs to the right.
  * Enter the town to the right of the castle.
  * Weapons Shop - Club
  * Go to the inn and take the warp wing from the drawers in the bottom right.
  * Item Shop (Bottom Right) - Dragon Scale/2 Torch/2 Herb
  * Equip
    * Weapon - Club
    * Accessory - Dragon Scale
  * Leave town.
  * Walk along forests and mountains (increased encounter rate) to get in fights
    to gain levels and head to Kol (North East part of the map). If you fight a
    Spooky you should use a torch, Scorpion run away.
  * Enter Kol and pickup the PixieFlute from in front of the guy just below the
    pool.

    the Mystic Nut and use it also. Stay on the second floor and pick up the
    iron shield as well.

    far as when it will show up, but you can keep trying as long as you don't
    free up a spot in the inventory.

## Iron Armor (Split 3)

    left of the city and enter the shop. Take the 120G from the left pot, and
    the Defense Seed from the right. Buy a full assortment of keys as well.
