# Dragon Warrior

Any % run on Emulator. I own the game, but an emulator is the easiest way to
play it with my setup. I've based my route off of a speed run from an
[RPG Limit Break][1] run, as well as a PB from [EvilAsh25][Evil Ash] that he did
right before RPG Limit Break.

### Threat Counter

For each step you take, the threat counter will rise. This includes steps in
town. You can utilize this to force encounters out of town earlier than you
normally would get them from just walking around.

**NOTE: Time starts after name (DRsh) is selected, and enter hit.**

## Pixie Flute (Split 1)

    to gain levels and head to Kol (North East part of the map). You should stay
    in close until you get to Lvl 2 via Red Slime and Slime creatures.
  * After you get to Lvl 2 you can move towards Kol and use a torch if you need
    to kill a stronger monster. Torches do 4-6 damage, and you should try to
    kill a stronger monster to get to level 3 before entering Kol. Ideally you
    have low HP, and can die to the damage tiles in there.
  * Enter Kol and pickup the PixieFlute from in front of the guy just below the
    pool.

    out of this with a full set of items for the next part.

    right. Use it and stay at the inn.
  * Weapon Shop (Top Right)
    * Sell - Club/Choker/Cloth

  * Head to Cantlin. You should fight battles with weak enemies and metal slimes
    only. If unsure, run. You want to be at Lvl 8 for the Golem fight. Note the

    * Use the Pixie Flute to keep him asleep and stay healed.
    * You can usually do 2 turns before he wakes up, and you should be doing
