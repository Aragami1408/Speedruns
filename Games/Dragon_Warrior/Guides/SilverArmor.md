# Silver Armor

The Silver Armor is an item with a fairly high defense stat, coming
just under Loto's Armor as far as the strongest in the game. We
actually end up skipping it however, as the amount of defense it
provides doesn't change the amount of hits it would take to die to
enemies. For example it has around 3-4 hp it saves per attack, but
when you are getting hit for 17 an attack and have an HP value of
53, you will take 4 hits to kill no matter what. That's just an
example, and [starofviolence][1] has actually done the math on this,
and determine it isn't worth getting.
