# Choker

The choker is an item we get for the sole purpose of selling. It sells for 1200,
which gives us almost enough to buy the steel sword outright. The interesting
part of the choker is that it is in a box that can also get you a torch, and has
a 1/16 chance of showing up. To make sure we get it, we fill out our items to
make sure we only pick up what we want from the chest. Each time the chest
resets, so we can ensure we get the choker.

## Items Management

We need 10 items to have a full inventory. At the time of the Rocky Mountain
Cave we will have these guaranteed items.

  1. Club
  2. Cloth Armor
  3. Pixie Flute
  4. Dragon Scale
  5. Warp Wing

We should have a 6th definite, but not guaranteed item in an herb (really more
than 1). In the cave we can get the MysticNut (7), StrengthSeed(8), and Iron
Shield (9). That means we need only 1 torch to ensure we are maxed out. This
means that whenever we item shop before coming here, we should buy up to 2
torches, and max out on herbs.
