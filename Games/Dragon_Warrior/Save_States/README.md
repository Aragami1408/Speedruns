# Save States

Save states are taken from the BGB emulator. They have the following setup

  * [Dragon Lord 1](./DragonLord1.sn0)
  * [Dragon Lord 2](./DragonLord2.sn1)

In order to use them, you should copy them into the top level directory for the
emulator ensuring they have the proper name to match up with the game.
