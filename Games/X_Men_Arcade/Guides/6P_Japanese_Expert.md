# X-Men Arcade 6P Japanese Expert

Any % type run on PS3. I'm noting from scratch here, so this can definitely be
more optimized going forward.

## General Knowledge

### Death

The key to a good run is knowing when you should die, and when you should fight
on. Taking on large amounts of enemies is very slow, and even though deaths cost
time, it might be preferable to getting down to the 5 character transition limit
using only punches most of the time.

### Powers

You can do 4 Ults assuming you have the energy token and full health. It's
very important to keep track of the health bar, and try not to get a single hp
taken via attack. I mean that literally as getting 1 hp taken off is the worst
state to be in. 2 means you can go down to 2 hp via powers and get killed by the
next attack. 1 means you go down to 3 hp, and take 2 attacks before you can be
killed. That extra attack can be worth a few seconds, so try to avoid it where
possible.

### Characters

We choose Colossus because of his ability. Everyone has roughly the same
movement speed, but their powers are very different.

  * Night Crawler - Power is unpredictable.
  * Dazzler - Power has a long wind up, and is a projectile
  * Wolverine - Narrow projectile. He'd probably be the second pick behind
                Colossus.
  * Storm - Fairly wide projectile, but very slow. Could be useful for cleaning
            up enemies across the stage, but so slow you could just jump hit
            with Colossus in about the same amount of time.
  * Cyclops - Same issue as Wolverine. Plus fuck this guy.

Colossus has an energy burst that has a radius from where he is standing. It's
pretty large and basically instant. He also has a jump->attack ability that
allows him to go incredibly fast through the air to make up distance.

### Jumping

You should almost always be jumping when moving the screen to avoid attacks.
This doesn't slow you down, but allows you to sometimes be missed when enemies
off screen take shots at you. Do note that Jump/Attacking is not the same thing.
If you are doing a jump attack, the screen will not move forward, so only jump.

### Verbage

  * Ult - Ultimate attack/Power/Whatever you want to call it when he kills all
          the things.

## Pyro (Split 1)

  * Jump->Attack and ult this first wave. You can get by here with only killing
    one enemy, but you actually want to cut your health for a later transition.
  * Ult as many enemies as possible to move to screen 3.
  * Ult on enemies coming down on right side to move to screen 4.
  * Ult again in order to move to screen 5. Make sure 5 or less enemies
    left, but leave one with a cannon to shoot you and kill you while the screen
    is moving.
  * Ult again on the right side enemies to move to screen 6.
  * As long as there are 5 or less Green Men you can transition to the Pryo
    fight.
  * **Pyro**
    * He needs 8 Ults to kill. He will always try to jump over you after
      you have powered off on him, so if he is low on health and you are willing
      to risk it, you can try and contain him with jump attacks or try catching
      him with normals after he jumps over you.

## Blob (Split 2)

  * Go all the way up, and a little to the right, then Ult here once the 2rd set
    of guys comes fully through the door. Obey the rule of 5.
  * Ult to clear the entire right side, but make sure you picked up enough
    stragglers to be down to 3 enemies.
  * Ult the right side again.
  * Move a bit to the left to get all the mid-screeners as well, then die.
  * Ult the hopefully congregated group.
  * Ult the right side.
  * Ult the right side again, and you should get to the door with the laser
    machines coming through.
  * Once the laser machines come through you have to clear this entire screen
    before going forward. This includes any lingering enemies as well.
  * Ult to clear the missile wall.
  * Ult as soon as the first sentinel walks through the door here.
  * Ult the right side, then immediately do a jump->attack to the left side.
  * Ult the left side when they show up.
  * **Blob**
    * Blob takes 10 Ults if you use an ult instead of an attack when he falls
      down. DON'T DO THIS!!!!!
    * Instead Ult/Punch Combo/Repeat. It takes 5 Ults if you do it this way.

## Welcome... To DIE!!! (Split 3)

  * Clear out the guys on the left first, then jump->attack to the right and Ult
    them as well.
  * Ult towards the middle to take out as many as you can.
  * Take out everyone on the right side, then move to the flower screen. Take a
    death.
  * Take out everyone with an ult here.
  * Hold a moment, then travel back towards the center to take out as many as
    possible with an Ult.
  * Careful on this screen as if you go all the way right you will get tail
    whipped.
  * 2 Ults to take out the Bee.
  * Careful on the right again, and move to the center to pull everyone in for
    an ult.
  * When guys are coming through the trees, hold off and try to pull everyone to
    the middle for an ult. Screen after is Welcome... TO DIE!!! and needs to be
    cleared out entirely.
  * Take a death if needed and clear out everything.
  * **Wendigo**
    * It takes 10 Ults to take down Wendigo.

## Nimrod? Really? (Split 4)

  * **Nimrod**

## Juggernaut (Split 5)

  * **Juggernaut**

## Who the fuck is this? (Split 6)

  * **Pharoah Bots**

## Not Mystique (Split 7)

  * The re-boss fights only allow 3 at a time, so take them out in a group if
    possible, but at least take out 1 go get to the next screen. To transition
    to Mystique, I'm not sure what the exact requirements are, but it looks like
    you can get to her if you have only one opponent alive (either Nimrod or
    Juggernaut).
  * **Mystique**
  * **Magneto**
