# Dragon Playthrough

Dragon is a character you get through completing the necessary requirements on your play through. He has a different
style than all of the other characters in that he accumulates gold to "hoard" items rather than buy them at a shop.
As the dragon you can't access any shops, fountains, blacksmiths, etc... so your only way of getting new items is
through level up, hoarding, or by the devour ability.

## Devour

Devour allows you to eat an enemy and potentially gain stats/cards depending on the enemy level and which enemy it is.
In general dead/undead enemies cause damage (but do give exp), and living enemies will give you access to the stats/cards
that closely relate to their skillset. For instance eating a mage might give you extra mana, and also a frost bolt card.
