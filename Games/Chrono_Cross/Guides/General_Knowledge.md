# General Knowledge

This is meant to be a catch all of general knowledge techniques that can be
applied to most any route/run type.

## Avoiding Fights

Always do this at all costs unless specified!!!! Even if you have to take an
extra few seconds to avoid a fight, it costs about 20 to run away.

## Switching Characters

Do this to rotate who you would like to attack first in a fight.

## Stat Ups

After each star your characters have the ability to receive a stat upgrade.
While these are random, the game itself is shooting for an average value for
different stats on each character. That doesn't mean you will hit them of
course, but if you miss multiple strength ups for instance, you should have a
higher likelihood of getting strength ups later. Note that a character that is
knocked out at the end of a battle will not receive stat upgrades.
