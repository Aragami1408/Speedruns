# Pokemon Red

Any% run using an emulator currently. I've based my notes off of the ones found
[here][1].

## Useful General Information

### Red Bar

Getting your health into red bar keeps pokemon from doing their cry at the
beginning of the fight. This can save a second or 2 depending on the pokemon. Of
course it's pretty risky to be at low health the whole game, but no risk no
reward after all.

## Before Staring (Split 0)

  * Clear any existing save file by pressing Up + B + Select on the game title
      screen 
  * Set text speed to FAST, battle animation to OFF and battle style to SHIFT

## Gary 1 (Split 1)

  * Give yourself and rival a one character name.
  * Withdraw potion from the PC in your home.
  * Choose Squirtle (2nd pokeball) and give it a one character name.
  * **Gary**
    * _Bulbasaur Lvl 5_

      whip. Use a potion if under 5 HP.

## Nidoran (Split 2)

      unless low on balls, then tackle twice.
