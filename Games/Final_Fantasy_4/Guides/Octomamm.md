# Octomamm

The fight with Octomamm follows a set pattern, where we will do

  * Switch Cecil's weapon to the Darkness Sword.
  * Cecil - Attack
  * Tellah - Lit-1
  * Rydia - Swap Rod for Dancing Dagger and throw it.
  * Rinse and Repeat. If Rydia dies have Tellah cast life.

Octomamm starts out with an incredible amount of speed, but everytime he loses
a tentacle it lowers. You can keep that in mind when trying to decide on whether
to heal up or not, and determining what HP value he is likely to be around.

The above fight is a generic "safe" way to fight Octomamm, but there is a faster
way that you can also try out as well.

  * Switch Cecil's weapon to the Darkness Sword.
  * Cecil - Attack
  * Tellah - Stop on self.
  * Rydia - Swap Rod for Dancing Dagger and throw it.
  * Cecil - Attack
  * Rydia - Dagger
  * Cecil - Attack
  * Cecil - Attack
  * Rydia - Dagger
  * ...

Tellah will need a second stop at some point in the fight, but the cycle is
pretty much as listed above. If you master that, you can save quite a bit of
time off the fight since Tellah hits for less or equal to Cecil, but his attack
animations take much longer. The danger is that you won't have a healer until he
becomes unstopped, but luckily stop doesn't negate him from being targeted, so
he can still tank some damage.
