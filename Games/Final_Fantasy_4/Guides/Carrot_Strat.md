# Carrot Strat

Carrot strat utilizes the mimic glitch to have Palom throw a Carrot (Fire3 x 8)
at Milon to inflict around 4k damage, which is a definite kill. The information
found here is based mostly off of these [notes][Notes]. The script is as
follows.

## Equipment

  * Cecil - Equip the Black Sword for the speed boost (NECESSARY!!!)
  * Palom - Equip the Change Rod and Gaea Helm for extra magic damage.

## Battle Script

  * **NOTE**: Milon has 3100 HP, but at 2100 he will give the Oh my body...
              message.
  * Cecil - Cure2 Zombie
  * Palom - Fire1 Porom (Wait until after Cure2 text goes away)
  * Count to 2 then Run Buffer
  * Porom - Run Buffer then Twin
  * Tellah - Life2 Palom
  * Cecil - Cure2 Zombie (Do this as fast as possible)
  * Cecil - Wait until Palom automatically throws a Cure2, then parry.
  * Palom - Should automatically Cure2 a zombie here due to mimic.
  * Tellah - Count to 2 then Stop on Cecil
  * Porom - Run Buffer then Attack Milon
  * Cecil - Select an Item for use (Say Life2), then deselect, then swap that
            item out with the carrot.
  * Palom - Should automatically throw carrot at Milon.
  * Tellah - Cure2 last Zombie.
