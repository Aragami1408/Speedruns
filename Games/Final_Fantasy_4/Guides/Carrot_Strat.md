# Carrot Strat

Carrot strat utilizes the mimic glitch to have Palom throw a Carrot (Fire3 x 8)
at Milon to inflict around 4k damage, which is a definite kill. The script is as
follows.

  * Palom - Fire1 Porom
  * Run Buffer
  * Porom - Twin
  * Tellah - Life2 Palom (Life2 is on the left, 1 down)
  * Cecil - Cure2 Zombie
  * Palom - Should automatically Cure2 a zombie here due to mimic.
  * Tellah - Stop on Cecil

  * Porom - Attack Milon
  * Cecil - Select an Item for use (Say Life2), then deselect, then swap that
            item out with the carrot.
