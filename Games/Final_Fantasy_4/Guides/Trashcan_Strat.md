# Trashcan Strat

Trashcan strat utilizes the mimic glitch to have Palom throw a Trashcan (White
x 8) at Milon to inflict around 4k damage, which is a definite kill. The
information found here is based mostly off of these [notes][Notes]. The script
is as follows.

## Equipment

  * Cecil - Equip the Black Sword for the speed boost (NECESSARY!!!)
  * Palom - Equip the Change Rod and Gaea Helm for extra magic damage. Can also
            equip with Gaea armor and Silver Ring for more protection.
  * Porom/Tellah - Can equip with Gaea Items and Silver Ring.

## Battle Script

  * **NOTE**: Milon has 3000 HP.
  * Cecil - Wait for MilonZ to attack. If Palom or Porom, Cure2 but do a 1 count
            after damage disappears. Otherwise parry after 1 count.
  * Cecil (possibly) - Run Buffer, then parry.
  * Palom - Run Buffer, Ice2 Porom
  * Tellah - (MilonZ will attack) Cast stop on Cecil as fast as possible. Finish
             before the Milon attack or you will need to run buffer after
             confirming stop.
  * Porom - Run Buffer and select Twin. Don't go too quickly otherwise Stop
            beats Ice2.
  * Cecil - Select Item for use, cancel usage, swap with Trashcan.
