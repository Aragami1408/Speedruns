These [notes][1] are based off the ones that [The_Roth][2] has and a Paladin
tutorial found [here][Paladin Tutorial].

## General Notes

The next few sections will be general info on useful techniques used in the run.
For more detailed info, follow the links to the more informative guides.

### Seed 92

Seed 92 references the RNG seed that you can get to ensure favorable encounters
throughout the run. There are 255 possible seeds, all with different amount of
steps to take before encountering a battle. 92 has no battles through Mist Dragon
and then very favorable fights after that as well. This [video][92 Seed Tutorial]
can show you how to get seed 92 consistently enough to be useful.

### Run Buffering

Running in battles where you can’t run halts the ATB while the “can’t run”
message appears. If you complete an action while this message is displayed your
party members act earlier in battle (e.g. Fabul fights) and it makes fights
faster/safer. If the message disappears and you are in the middle of targeting a
monster, you need to run buffer again right after confirming an action to still
act earlier. A Tutorial on this can be found [here][Run Buffering Tutorial].

### General Info

  * Try to predict which character acts next, sometimes you can hold A to attack
    immediately.
  * Remember where you are when you get encounters so you can start walking
    straight away.
  * Hold X while walking to enter the menu without delay.
  * For single text boxes just mash quickly. For longer text, try to mash
    rhythmically and look at the screen. It’s hard to explain but you’ll get the
    gist of it.
  * You can mash with any button, e.g. in item shops you can press A once to buy
    an item and then press down twice to select the next item (avoids buying two
    of one item by accident).
  * You can change rows in the Form menu by pressing left or right before
    selecting characters.
  * Press X to increase the # of items bought by 10, or to change from White to
    Black magic.
  * You can act in the menu quicker than you think, i.e. while the boxes are
    sliding around.

## Mist (Split 1)

  * Mash text until you speak to the king and are kicked out.
  * Head down the stairs and get the right most treasure chest for a tent.
  * Head to Cecil's chamber (Upper Left Tower) taking the extra step to the
    right on the chair if you are on the correct seed. If you don't know what
    that means just go to bed.
  * Menu
    * Custom - Battle Speed and Battle Message to 1 (Fastest)
  * Go to chocobo forest (SouthEast of the castle), and pick up a chocobo to
    take to the Cave of Mist. If doing [Carrot Strat][Carrot Strat] pick up the
    carrot here as well.
  * Go through the cavern until you fight the Mist Dragon.
  * **[Mist Dragon][Mist Dragon] (465 HP)**
    * Kain jump and Cecil attack until Dragon turns to mist. 3rd jump by Kain
      might be better off as a standard attack.
    * Kain jump after waiting for [audio cue][4] to make sure Dragon is back
      from the mist.
    * While text is rolling manage the inventory by selecting the slot under
      the tent to move the shadow shield to. Then move the tent to where the
      package is.
    * After Kain lands continue having Kain jump and Cecil attack until the
      Dragon is dead.
  * [Mist Skip!][Mist Skip]
  * Item duplication should be done during Mist Skip, as getting into a fight
    will cause you to lose the item.
  * Enter Mist Village, and go to the Weapon Shop. Sell the duplicated shields
    that are in the top left empty item slot. Use that to buy 10 Dancing
    Daggers.
  * Go up to the house in the top left corner of the town, and enter the
    fireplace to go grab the Tiara (Top Left chest) and the Change Rod (Very
    Bottom Chest by itself).
  * Now go to the left entrance of the village to start the cutscene and get
    destroyed by Rydia.

    a bridge. Grab the Darkness Sword.
