# Fabul Gauntlet

The Fabul Gauntlet is a series of 6 encounters where your party consists of
Cecil, Edward, and Yang, with all battles coming immediately after each other.
This is a very dangerous situation, as Edward is your main damage dealer, and if
he gets into critical health he will hide, making it impossible to use his
attacks to one hit kill enemies.

## Run Buffering

These fights can be made much easier with a technique called run buffering.
The basic gist of it is that ATBs do not progress while a message is on screen.
We can use that to our advantage to enable Edward to go before enemies, and
since he is able to one hit kill everything here we can automatically kill one
enemy before they get a chance to attack. This both speeds up the battle, and
makes it much safer as you just reduced damage output by around 30 HP to one
character. That's about 180 HP saved across the group over the course of the
fights.

## UP + A

Just knowing that run buffering is a thing isn't enough, you still need to be
able to input your action before the enemy gets their turn off as well. You can
utilize a mechanic in the Guard fights to ensure your inputs are fast enough.
After you do the run buffer and bring up the text box you should hit the UP and
the A button (in that order) and hold them. This will automatically target the
top Guard with a Dancing Dagger throw, and will be done fast enough that you
will make the action select in the window of the "Can't Run Away" message.
