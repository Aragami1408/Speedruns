# Save States

Save states are taken from the SNES9x v1.53 emulator. They have the following
setup

  * [Mist Dragon](./Final%25Fantasy%25II%25(USA).000)
  * [Mist Skip](./Final%25Fantasy%25II%25(USA).001)
  * [Octomamm](./Final%25Fantasy%25II%25(USA).002)
  * [Mom Bomb](./Final%25Fantasy%25II%25(USA).003)
  * [Fabul Gauntlet](./Final%25Fantasy%25II%25(USA).004)
  * [Milon](./Final%25Fantasy%25II%25(USA).005)

In order to use them, you should copy them into the "Saves" directory for the
emulator ensuring they have the proper name to match up with the game.
