# StreamPro

StreamPro is a service that helps you manage donations, new followers, and new
subscribers. It lets you create an overlay and uses the twitch api to manage
everything.

## Setting up an Overlay

Just go to StreamPro and link your twitch account. From there it's pretty
straight forward with choose a template (or use your own), and then modify any
alerts you feel you need to. Try just adding one widget like a followers total
first, and then importing it in to something like your OBS scene to see what it
looks like. Personally I like to only use StreamPro for Twitch API type
information like new followers/subscribers/etc... and make the rest of the setup
myself in OBS.
